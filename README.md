# 💻 Tsunami Exploit Creator 🌊

Welcome to the Tsunami Exploit Creator! This project guides you through the process of creating a vulnerable program and constructing a payload to exploit it. It's an educational journey through the world of application security. 

## 📚 What's Inside?

Tsunami is a two-step procedure - creating a vulnerable program and crafting the payload to exploit it. Once you confirm that your created application is vulnerable, it's time to design an exploit to take advantage of that vulnerability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The following steps guide you through the process:

1. **Creation of the exploit.** The program is named `tsunami.exe` and accepts a parameter as an argument. 
2. **Creation of the payload.** The payload, when exploiting the vulnerability, will automatically open the Windows XP calculator. Quite a sight to see! 🧮
3. **Payload content.** The payload must contain shellcode that executes your intended instructions. The key part of this project is building your payload - it's crucial to understand and analyze existing ones but always strive to develop your own, rather than simply copying from sources like Shell-storm.

## 🔐 Security

This project is about understanding and learning, not causing harm. Always remember that exploiting vulnerabilities is a legal and ethical issue. Only use this knowledge for legitimate penetration testing and security research, and always with permission. 

## 🌐 Start Exploiting!

Now that you know what this project is all about, you can dive into the world of exploit creation! Remember, knowledge is power - use it wisely and ethically.
